<h1>Francois Quesnay</h1>
<img class="bio" src="http://images.fineartamerica.com/images-medium-large-5/franois-quesnay-granger.jpg"></img>
<b>4th June 1694 – 16th December 1774</b>
<br />
<b>School:</b> Physiocrat <br />
<b>Key works: </b> <i>Tableau Economique</i> (1758)
<p>Leading figure in the Physiocrat school of economics, one of the first distinct schools of thought. His <i>Tableau Economique</i> (Economic Table) was one of the first systematic analyses of the circular flow of income in an economy. He was also noted for his early criticism of mercantilism and his focus on agriculture as the source of value in the economy.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Adam Smith</h1>
<img class="bio" src="http://www.blupete.com/Literature/Biographies/Philosophy/Portraits/smith.gif"></img>
<b>5th June 1723 – 17th July 1790</b>
<br />
<b>School:</b> Classical <br />
<b>Key works: </b> <i>The Wealth of Nations</i> (1776), <i>The Theory of Moral Sentiments</i> (1759)
<p>Almost universally considered to be the father of economics, Smith's work revolutionised the subject. He is best known for his discussion of how people working in their self-interest within free markets may produce a socially beneficial outcome (the so-called "invisible hand", although Smith did not use the term when describing this). He also illustrated the benefits of intra- and international trade, and the increased efficiency that arises from division of labour. He travelled fairly frequently, but most of his life was spent either teaching at Glasgow University or at his home in Kirkcaldy.</p>

<div class="section">
<h1>Thomas Robert Malthus</h1>
<img class="bio" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/Thomas_Robert_Malthus.jpg"></img>
<b>13th February 1766 – 23rd December 1834</b>
<br />
<b>School:</b> Classical <br />
<b>Key works: </b> <i>An Essay on the Principle of Population</i> (1798), <i>Principles of Political Economy</i> (1820)
<p>Malthus is perhaps best known for his gloomy prediction that population growth would tend to outstrip economic growth, leading to the persistence of poverty and starvation. The failure of this prediction has discredited him, but Malthus made many other important contributions to economics; he was the first to clearly distinguish between <i>demand</i> and <i>quantity demanded</i>, and he was one of the few classical economists who researched the idea of a business cycle and the idea that Say's Law (supply creates its own demand) might not hold. He spent most of his academic life as Professor of History and Political Economy at the East India Company College in Hertfordshire.</p>

<h1>David Ricardo</h1>
<img class="bio" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ekMTWZ7ggOI/UjIKjKPu0KI/AAAAAAAAA_k/Lwt7dNc7Xv0/s1600/David_Ricardo.jpg"></img>
<b>18th April 1772 – 11th September 1823</b>
<br />
<b>School:</b> Classical <br />
<b>Key works: </b> <i>On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation</i> (1817), <i>Essay on the Influence of a Low Price of Corn on the Profits of Stock</i> (1815), <i>The High Price of Bullion</i> (1809)
<p>Most famous for his work on comparative advantage, the mathematical reasoning proving that free trade between countries always benefits both countries. Also gave the first clear explanation of the Law of Diminishing Marginal Returns, and was an early exponent of the quantity theory of money (increases in the money supply will increase prices by the same amount). He also argued that landowners would receive rent due to the scarcity of land, which was effectively money for nothing. Never an academic, but made a fortune as a stockbroker, and in the last few years of his life became an MP.</p>

<div class="section">
<h1>Karl Marx</h1>
<img class="bio" src="http://chabadsociologist.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/marx.jpg"></img>
<b>5th May 1818 - 14th March 1883</b>
<br />
<b>School:</b> Classical/Marxist <br />
<b>Key works: </b> <i>Capital</i> (1867-94), <i>Value, Price and Profit</i> (1865), <i>The Communist Manifesto</i> (1848)
<p>Marx is undoubtedly the most controversial figure in the history of economics, but the failures of twentieth-century Communist regimes should not be used to discredit Marx's economic thought. Marx was the first to argue that crises, and the business cycle, were an unavoidable part of capitalist economies. He was one of the first to describe the transformative impact of the Industrial Revolution, and the importance of innovation in the economy. He also inspired the heterodox Marxian school of economics, which focuses on capitalism's tendency to crisis and is based on Marx's less mainstream ideas, such as the tendency for the rate of profit to fall and the labour theory of value. He spent much of his life in London, from where he led the international Communist movement.</p>

<h1>William Stanley Jevons</h1>
<img class="bio" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Jevons.jpeg/220px-Jevons.jpeg"></img>
<b>1st September 1835 - 13th August 1882</b>
<br />
<b>School:</b>Neoclassical<br />
<b>Key works: </b> <i>The Theory of Political Economy</i> (1871), <i>The Coal Question</i> (1865)
<p>William Stanley Jevons was one of the three leaders of the Marginal Revolution, along with Leon Walras and Carl Menger. Jevons developed the theory of marginal utility - that the value of a good is determined by the amount of pleasure caused by the next additional unit of that good. This was based on the philosophical concept of utilitarianism developed by Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill. He was trained as a natural scientist and brought a scientific approach to economics, including the belief that economics should use mathematics. He also observed the so-called Jevons paradox, that the use of energy tends to increase when energy efficiency is increased, as the cost of energy is reduced. Jevons taught at Owens College, Manchester (now the University of Manchester) and University College London.</p>

<h3>Henry George</h3>
<img class="minibio" src="http://www.econlib.org/library/YPDBooks/George/George.gif"></img>
<b>2nd September 1839 – 29th October 1897</b>
<br />
<b>School:</b> Georgist <br />
<b>Key works: </b> <i>Progress and Poverty</i> (1879)
<p>George was a popular rather than an academic economist, but was extremely influential in his time. Most of his writings were on the nature and importance of land in the economy. He was a noted advocate of a tax on the unimproved value of land, on the grounds that it would not have any economic distortions but could still raise revenue. He believed that speculation on land was at the root of economic instability and a drain on the economy. He lived in California and later New York City, where he wrote, spoke and occasionally stood for election to various offices, though he was never elected.</p>

<div class="section">
<h1>John Maynard Keynes</h1>
<img class="bio" src="http://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/blog-uploads/2013/02/keynes.jpg"></img>
<b>5th June 1883 - 21st April 1946</b>
<br />
<b>School:</b>Keynesian<br />
<b>Key works: </b> <i>The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money</i> (1936), <i>The Economic Consequences of the Peace</i> (1920)
<p>Keynes is almost certainly the most important economist of the Twentieth Century. His <i>General Theory</i> transformed mainstream thought about the management of the economy, and had a strong influence on economic policy both in the 40 years following its publication and in 2008. His key contributions were the concept of aggregate demand, and the idea that a deficiency in this could lead to unemployment but could be cured by government policy. He also overturned the idea that the economy would naturally reach a low-unemployment equilibrium. Keynes studied and later taught at Cambridge University, as well as advising the British government on economic policy.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Milton Friedman</h1>
<img class="bio" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7w_87c2L_2s/UD-6rOgf93I/AAAAAAAADFQ/dS0LA2DrdFQ/s1600/milton_friedman_kX9lK_19672.jpg"></img>
<b>31st July 1912 - 16th November 2006</b>
<br />
<b>School:</b>Monetarist<br />
<b>Key works: </b> <i>A Monetary History of the United States, 1867-1960</i> (1963), <i>A Theory of the Consumption Function</i> (1957), <i>A Program for Monetary Stability</i> (1960)
<p>Milton Friedman was a prominent advocate of monetarism, the theory that changes in the money supply played an important role in determining the real level of output. <i>A Monetary History</i> provided evidence of the importance of monetary policy from 100 years of American history. He also disputed the Keynesian idea that individuals have a constant marginal propensity to save in favour of the so-called 'permanent income hypothesis' which states that people spend a particular proportion of their expected income over their lifetime. He won the Nobel Prize in 1976 for both of these achievements. Friedman taught for most of his life at the University of Chicago.</p>

<h3>Robert Lucas</h3>
<img class="bio" src="http://chicagoboyz.net/wp-content/uploads/robert-lucas.jpg"></img>
<b>15th September 1937 - </b>
<br />
<b>School:</b>New Classical<br />
<b>Key works: </b> <i>Econometric Policy Evaluation: A Critique</i> (1976), <i>Expectations and the neutrality of money</i> (1972)
<p>Robert Lucas is one of the most important economists of the last 50 years. He introduced the concept of rational expectations - the idea that people generally have realistic expectations about what will happen to the economy - which transformed the study of macroeconomic policy, as it meant that the government could not consistently fool the public about their intentions. He also contributed the Lucas Critique, based on rational expectations, which argued that historical data cannot be relied on for economic modelling, as people would eventually change their expectations if the government relied on past economic relationships. He has taught at the University of Chicago for the past few decades.</p>
