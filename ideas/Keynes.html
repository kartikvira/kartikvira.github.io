<b>5th June 1883 - 21st April 1946</b>
<br />
<b>School:</b>Keynesian<br />
<b>Key works: </b> <i>The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money</i> (1936), <i>The Economic Consequences of the Peace</i> (1920)
<p>Keynes is almost certainly the most important economist of the Twentieth Century. His <i>General Theory</i> transformed mainstream thought about the management of the economy, and had a strong influence on economic policy both in the 40 years following its publication and in 2008. His key contributions were the concept of aggregate demand, and the idea that a deficiency in this could lead to unemployment but could be cured by government policy. He also overturned the idea that the economy would naturally reach a low-unemployment equilibrium. Keynes studied and later taught at Cambridge University, as well as advising the British government on economic policy.</p>
