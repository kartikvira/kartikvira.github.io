<p>Most famous for his work on comparative advantage, the mathematical reasoning proving that free trade between countries always benefits both countries. Also gave the first clear explanation of the Law of Diminishing Marginal Returns, and was an early exponent of the quantity theory of money (increases in the money supply will increase prices by the same amount). He also argued that landowners would receive rent due to the scarcity of land, which was effectively money for nothing. Never an academic, but made a fortune as a stockbroker, and in the last few years of his life became an MP.</p>
