<p>Malthus is perhaps best known for his gloomy prediction that population growth would tend to outstrip economic growth, leading to the persistence of poverty and starvation. The failure of this prediction has discredited him, but Malthus made many other important contributions to economics; he was the first to clearly distinguish between <i>demand</i> and <i>quantity demanded</i>, and he was one of the few classical economists who researched the idea of a business cycle and the idea that Say's Law (supply creates its own demand) might not hold. He spent most of his academic life as Professor of History and Political Economy at the East India Company College in Hertfordshire.</p>
