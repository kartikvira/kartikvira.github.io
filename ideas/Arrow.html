<b>23<sup>rd</sup> August 1931 -</b>
<br />

<p>Kenneth Arrow is best known in economics for his groundbreaking analysis of general equilibrium, which forms the basis for much of modern macroeconomics. With Debreu and McKenzie, he extended and formalised Walras' theory of general equilibrium. He also contributed to the theory of economic behaviour with uncertainty and asymmetric information, as well as work on the role of experience in increasing productivity. His best-known contribution, though it is less related to economics, is his Impossibility Theorem, which mathematically proves that no voting system can provide a ranking of options that satisfies the desires of a whole community. He has spent most of his career at Stanford University.</p>
