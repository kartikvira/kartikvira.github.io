<b>26<sup>th</sup> July 1842 â€“ 13<sup>th</sup> July 1924</b>
<br />
<b>School:</b> Neoclassical <br />
<b>Key works: </b> <i>Principles of Economics</i> (1890)
<p>Marshall is best known for his textbook, <i>Principles of Economics</i>, which had a great influence on the study of economics for the next 50 years. It popularised the Neoclassical ideas of Jevons and Walras, particularly the idea of marginal utility, as well as Cournot's supply and demand diagrams. Marshall also contributed many new ideas in his textbook, including the ideas of elasticity (the responsiveness of one factor to another factor, such as price and demand), and the short and long run. Marshall spent most of his career as Professor of Political Economy at Cambridge, where he taught many leading economists of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, including Keynes.</p>
