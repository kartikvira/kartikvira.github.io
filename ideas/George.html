<p>George was a popular rather than an academic economist, but was extremely influential in his time. Most of his writings were on the nature and importance of land in the economy. He was a noted advocate of a tax on the unimproved value of land, on the grounds that it would not have any economic distortions but could still raise revenue. He believed that speculation on land was at the root of economic instability and a drain on the economy. He lived in California and later New York City, where he wrote, spoke and occasionally stood for election to various offices, though he was never elected.</p>
