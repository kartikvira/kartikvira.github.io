<p>Milton Friedman was a prominent advocate of monetarism, the theory that changes in the money supply played an important role in determining the real level of output. <i>A Monetary History</i> provided evidence of the importance of monetary policy from 100 years of American history. He also disputed the Keynesian idea that individuals have a constant marginal propensity to save in favour of the so-called 'permanent income hypothesis' which states that people spend a particular proportion of their expected income over their lifetime. He won the Nobel Prize in 1976 for both of these achievements. Friedman taught for most of his life at the University of Chicago.</p>
