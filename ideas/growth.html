    <h1>Economic Growth</h1>
    <p>Economic growth was one of the first concepts to be thought of using economic methods. Some of the first ideas on this topic came from mercantilist thinkers. Mercantilists held that economic growth would arise from maintaining a positive balance of payments, and therefore that the government should support exports and restrict imports in order to maintain this. If a country exported more than it imported, it would receive large amounts of gold and silver from other countries; some early thinkers believed that such metals were the only source of value in the economy. This contradicts our current beliefs that any product can be a source of value for the economy. However, there is some logic to the mercantilist viewpoint, as discussed by Keynes in his General Theory: in a society where the currency is entirely gold-based, increasing the quantity of precious metals is the only way to increase the money supply; a money supply that does not grow with the real economy will cause deflation, which could depress real growth. However, this justification for mercantilist ideas on growth was not fully understood by mercantilists themselves, and their understanding of the sources of value and growth for an economy was poor. </p>
    <p>Physiocrats such as <a class="hasTooltip" id="Quesnay">Francois Quesnay</a> also had theories of economic growth. In his <i>Tableau Economique</i>, Quesnay argued that all value and economic growth was derived from agriculture. He referred to the expenditures in the manufacturing sector as "sterile expenditures", which did not produce any value; he believed that only agriculture produced a surplus (more than necessary to provide for the workers). Agricultural production and expenditure, however, would circulate through the economy to produce an increase in income for everyone. This again contradicts the modern notion that any increases in production constitute economic growth. However, Quesnay was the first to develop the idea of the circular flow of income; that is, that the proceeds from economic growth would circulate through the economy to benefit everyone. This was visually illustrated in the <i>Tableau</i>, which is reproduced (translated from the French) below.</p>

    <p>The Classical theory of economic growth was developed by the leading Classical economists: <a class="hasTooltip" id="Smith">Smith</a>, <a class="hasTooltip" id="Malthus">Malthus</a> and <a class="hasTooltip" id="Ricardo">Ricardo</a>. The first difference from the Physiocrats was that Classical economists generalised their principle of surplus to apply to all industries, not just agriculture. They believed that this surplus could generally be used for the accumulation of capital, which would contribute to growth by allowing more division of labour and greater productivity. They identified two other factors of production: land and labour. They generally did not believe, however, that either of these could contribute significantly to growth. Ricardo noted that land was ultimately in limited supply; it cannot be created. This means that land growth could not contribute significantly to economic growth. Malthus' ideas on labour were also influential; he argued that population growth was dependent on economic growth, rather than a cause of it. As accumulation of capital produced higher incomes, people would be able to afford to have more children, and would therefore do so in accordance with their natural instincts. This would cause the higher income to be distributed among a larger population, so in practise GDP per capita would never increase significantly, in the long run. Technological progress was noted as a cause of growth, but was not given much attention; this is likely to be because the authors were writing before the progress of the Industrial Revolution had become obvious (Malthus was the last of the three to die, in 1834) and there had been no great leaps in productivity due to technology in recent history in Britain; furthermore, they believed that technological progress required capital, so the accumulation of capital remained the most important factor. They believed, in addition, that all of these factors of production and causes of growth were subject to diminishing returns. As a result, they thought that the economy would eventually reach a "stationary state", where both economic growth (and therefore population growth) had stopped. However, they believed that international trade could help to alleviate this problem by </p>
    <p>Marx's approach to economic growth theory was not revolutionary - he developed the Classical growth theory, rather than attempting to replace it. Having the advantage of writing later in the Industrial Revolution, he placed more focus on the role of technological progress in creating economic growth - and, indeed, on the role of entrepreneurs in causing this progress. He rejected the Malthusian idea that population would inevitably increase to match economic output, calling it "a libel on the human race" - in this he is supported by history. He also drew more attention to the affect that distribution and demand might have on growth; he observed that, if workers were paid too little, there would be less demand for products and therefore fewer profitable investments to makes, stifling economic growth.</p>
    <p>The Marginal Revolution shifted attention from macroeconomics to microeconomics, and theories of economic growth subsequently fell by the wayside. Joseph Schumpeter, writing in the 1920s and 30s, elaborated on Marx's points about the importance of innovation, technological progress and entrepreneurs to economic growth; he believed that innovation, and economic growth, required a process of "creative destruction", where old, failing business models are destroyed to make room for the new ones created by technology. He also thought that some degree of monopoly would benefit innovation and economic growth, as monopolies have extra funding with which to fund research and development that is not accessible when the same service is provided by lots of small firms.</p>
    <p>After World War II, various more formal models of economic growth were created. The Harrod-Domar model proposed that economic growth depended on the marginal productivity of capital, the savings rate, and the rate of depreciation of capital. However, this focus on only capital was limiting, and the model made some unrealistic assumptions, such as that there were no diminishing marginal returns on capital. The model was later extended by Solow and Swan, who assumed diminishing returns, allowed for shifts in the use of capital and labour, and more explicitly included technological progress in the model. The Solow-Swan model thus mathematised most of the views on growth from past history, and remains the basic standard for economic growth models. However, it did not have an explanation for the causes of the all-important technological progress, but simply assumed this would take place; it also predicted that without technological progress, economic growth would eventually stop, as predicted by Classical Economists. In the 1980s, Paul Romer and Robert Lucas attempted to solve this problem by </p>
