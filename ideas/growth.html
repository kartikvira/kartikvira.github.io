    <h1>Economic Growth</h1>
    <p>Economic growth was one of the first concepts to be thought of using economic methods. Some of the first ideas on this topic came from mercantilist thinkers. Mercantilists held that economic growth would arise from maintaining a positive balance of payments, and therefore that the government should support exports and restrict imports in order to maintain this. If a country exported more than it imported, it would receive large amounts of gold and silver from other countries; some early thinkers believed that such metals were the only source of value in the economy. This contradicts our current beliefs that any product can be a source of value for the economy. However, there is some logic to the mercantilist viewpoint, as discussed by Keynes in his General Theory: in a society where the currency is entirely gold-based, increasing the quantity of precious metals is the only way to increase the money supply; a money supply that does not grow with the real economy will cause deflation, which could depress real growth. However, this justification for mercantilist ideas on growth was not fully understood by mercantilists themselves, and their understanding of the sources of value and growth for an economy was poor. </p>
    <p>Physiocrats such as Francois Quesnay also had theories of economic growth. In his <i>Tableau Economique</i>, Quesnay argued that all value and economic growth was derived from agriculture. He referred to the expenditures in the manufacturing sector as "sterile expenditures", which did not produce any value. Agricultural production and expenditure, however, would circulate through the economy to produce an increase in income for everyone. This again contradicts the modern notion that any increases in production constitute economic growth. However, Quesnay was the first to develop the idea of the circular flow of income; that is, that the proceeds from economic growth would circulate through the economy to benefit everyone. This was visually illustrated in the <i>Tableau</i>, which is reproduced (translated from the French) below.</p>

    <p>Adam Smith's ideas on growth, as on so many of the topics in economics, laid the real foundation for future thought. Smith believed that the source of economic growth was the increasing division of labour: "The division of labour, however, so far as it can be introduced, occasions, in every art, a proportionable increase of the productive powers of labour." If workers are able to focus on different tasks, they will gain expertise in that task, and will not have to waste time switching between tasks; this increases their productivity. increasing the stock of capital will also promote growth, by assisting the division of labour and by allowing each labourer to produce more. it is important that Smith was the first to clearly state that economic growth was an increase in the productive capacity of the economy - the total value of the goods and services that a country can produce. This definition is the basis for modern measurements of GDP.

    <blockquote>The annual labour of every nation is the fund which originally supplies it with all the necessaries and conveniencies of life which it annually consumes, and which consist always either in the immediate produce of that labour, or in what is purchased with that produce from other nations. According therefore, as this produce, or what is purchased with it, bears a greater or smaller proportion to the number of those who are to consume it, the nation will be better or worse supplied with all the necessaries and conveniencies for which it has occasion.
    </blockquote>

    Smith also stated, famously, that "the division of labour is limited by the extent of the market". When division of labour is introduced, people cannot produce some of their needs and wants, and have to trade for them. This is only possible where a market exists. So if markets and trade expand, division of labour can be allowed to continue, which will promote economic growth.
    <p> Other classical economists expanded on Smith's theories of growth. David Ricardo expanded Smith's ideas on the benefits of trade to whole economies, with his principle of comparative advantage. He demonstrated that every country is able to produce some good at a lower opportunity cost than any other country - they have a comparative advantage in some goods. Ricardo then showed that total output would be increased if every country focused on the production of those goods in which they had a comparative advantage, and traded those for goods produced by other countries. This is analogous to the benefits of trade and division of labour described by Smith. So international trade can also contribute to economic growth. Note that this does not rely on exports exceeding imports, unlike earlier mercantilist thought. </p>
    <p> Thomas Malthus had a more pessimistic attitude to economic growth. He believed that any increases in the productive capacity of the economy, for reasons described by Adam Smith, would be absorbed by corresponding increases in population. As division of labour and increasing capital have diminishing marginal returns, there would come a point where the new members of the population would consume more than they produced by allowing division of labour to continue. This would mean that average incomes could never increase in the long run. Malthus was, of course, contradicted by the evidence of history: birth rates fell as countries developed, rather than increasing, and so average incomes could increase.</p>
