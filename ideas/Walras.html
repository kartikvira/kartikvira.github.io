<p>Walras was one of the three leaders of the Marginal Revolution, along with William Stanley Jevons and Carl Menger. As well as working on the concept of marginal utility, Walras is best known for his work on general equilibrium - analysing a system where the market for every good, and all economic variables, are in a state of equilibrium. Before Walras, there had been little analysis of the way that different markets interact. He also simulated a process by which this equilibrium might be reached, similar to an auction, which he referred to as "tâtonnement". Walras spent most of his career as Professor of Political Economy at the University of Lausanne.</p>
