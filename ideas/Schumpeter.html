<p>Joseph Schumpeter was an unorthodox economist of the early 20<sup>th</sup> century. He is best known for developing theory on the importance of innovation in a capitalist economy. Schumpeter argued that entrepreneurs and innovation were responsible for development in capitalism, preventing the economy from reaching the "steady state" predicted by Classical economists. He coined the phrase "creative destruction" to describe the process by which the creation of new products and techniques forces old, inefficient ones to be destroyed. He also argued that monopolies could be beneficial, as their higher profits meant they had more money to fund innovation. He also had an unusual theory of business cycles, attributing economic fluctuations to four different cycles, each of different lengths, which interact with each other. Schumpeter spent most of his career teaching at Harvard University.</p>
