<p>Robert Lucas is one of the most important economists of the last 50 years. He introduced the concept of rational expectations - the idea that people generally have realistic expectations about what will happen to the economy - which transformed the study of macroeconomic policy, as it meant that the government could not consistently fool the public about their intentions. He also contributed the Lucas Critique, based on rational expectations, which argued that historical data cannot be relied on for economic modelling, as people would eventually change their expectations if the government relied on past economic relationships. He has taught at the University of Chicago for the past few decades.</p>
