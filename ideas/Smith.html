<p>Almost universally considered to be the father of economics, Smith's work revolutionised the subject. He is best known for his discussion of how people working in their self-interest within free markets may produce a socially beneficial outcome (the so-called "invisible hand", although Smith did not use the term when describing this). He also illustrated the benefits of intra- and international trade, and the increased efficiency that arises from division of labour. He travelled fairly frequently, but most of his life was spent either teaching at Glasgow University or at his home in Kirkcaldy.</p>
