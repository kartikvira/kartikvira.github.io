<p>Marx is undoubtedly the most controversial figure in the history of economics, but the failures of twentieth-century Communist regimes should not be used to discredit Marx's economic thought. Marx was the first to argue that crises, and the business cycle, were an unavoidable part of capitalist economies. He was one of the first to describe the transformative impact of the Industrial Revolution, and the importance of innovation in the economy. He also inspired the heterodox Marxian school of economics, which focuses on capitalism's tendency to crisis and is based on Marx's less mainstream ideas, such as the tendency for the rate of profit to fall and the labour theory of value. He spent much of his life in London, from where he led the international Communist movement.</p>
