<p>Gary Becker greatly expanded the horizons of economics, by applying economic analysis (specifically neoclassical rational choice theory) to many non-economic aspects of life. One of his first works was on discrimination, and argued that discrimination in the labour market is harmful to the discriminating employer. He also produced a rational model of how people decide between work and leisure, argued that the decision to commit crime is a rational choice made by weighing up the costs and benefits of breaking the law, and later sought to explain the existence of families and addiction based on rational choice. He taught at the Universities of Columbia and Chicago for most of his career.</p>
