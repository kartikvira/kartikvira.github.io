    <h1>400 Years of Scarcity: a history of economic thought</h1>
    <blockquote>
    The ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are right and when they are wrong, are more powerful than is commonly understood. Indeed the world is ruled by little else. Practical men, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influences, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist. Madmen in authority, who hear voices in the air, are distilling their frenzy from some academic scribbler of a few years back. I am sure that the power of vested interests is vastly exaggerated compared with the gradual encroachment of ideas. Not, indeed, immediately, but after a certain interval; for in the field of economic and political philosophy there are not many who are influenced by new theories after they are twenty-five or thirty years of age, so that the ideas which civil servants and politicians and even agitators apply to current events are not likely to be the newest. But, soon or late, it is ideas, not vested interests, which are dangerous for good or evil.

    <p>Economics is perhaps the single most important academic discipline of modern times, affecting the lives of every person living in our globalised society. One need only need to look to Greece or Tunisia to see the importance of economic ideas on the day-to-day life of ordinary people. The great political divides in society primarily focus on differing visions of the economy, and huge events in the course of history for the past 250 years can be traced to a powerful economic idea in the right place, at the right time. Yet, as economic debates rage within academia and the wider social sphere, there is little discussion of the origins of these ideas. Economics is a relatively young discipline, the modern study of which began over 200 years after Copernicus proposed that the Earth went round the Sun, but it has seen rapid development during this time.</p>
